# Complex Hex

... is an addon for Hexcasting with whatever I feel like adding lol. \
[wiki](https://complexhex.hexxy.media)

## features
complex numbers - exactly what it says on the tin lmao \
quaternions - " \
Bubbles - put an iota in a bubble (an iota itsself) which when executed via hermes or the likes, will push its contents to the stack \
BIT Manipulation - patterns to summon, kill and manipulate Block, Item, and Text Displays (BITs) 

## Ideas
patterns to allow wisps to wait for an interactionEntity to do something? \
double casting item that would have two different hexes, which would be cast on subsequent uses but preserve ravenmind and/or stack in the middle? \
maybe even a multi-casting item which could have an arbitrary amount of hexes? \
burnt amethyst? made by smelting normal shards which makes it "unhappy" and does the gaslighting thing between brown, yellow, and green shades? \
decorative goblet called a-methustos (where the word amethyst comes from, means not drunk in greek)?
